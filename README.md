# Food-Delivery-System-Graphs-CPP

Created a dataset of restaurants and their food items along with the distance 
from the selected destination, and created a graph with nodes as all the 
restaurants and the locations from the data set with weighted edges the 
distance between the two nodes.
Using greedy paradigm and Dijkstra algorithm the shortest path was calculated 
to simulate a delivery system for selected nodes.
The user may choose the location of their whereabouts and according to the 
location a list of top restaurants will be displayed. The user will then be asked 
to choose a filter to display the restaurants on the basis of the price or ETA 
from your location. The user may then select the restaurant and further the 
food items they want to order by inputting serial number and quantity
afterwards there’s an option to use discount coupons and all.
The mode of payment will also be asked by the module and finally your food 
will be order successfully and module will show a “map” of all the points your 
delivery agent is going to traverse through.
These points are found using Dijkstra’s algorithm according to the nodes I
selected
